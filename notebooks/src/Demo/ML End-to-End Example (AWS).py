# MAGIC %md # Training Machine Learning Models on Tabular Data: An End-to-End Example
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This tutorial covers the following steps:
# MAGIC - Import data from your local machine into the Databricks File System (DBFS)
# MAGIC - Visualize the data using Seaborn and matplotlib
# MAGIC - Run a parallel hyperparameter sweep to train machine learning models on the dataset
# MAGIC - Explore the results of the hyperparameter sweep with MLflow
# MAGIC - Register the best performing model in MLflow
# MAGIC - Apply the registered model to another dataset using a Spark UDF
# MAGIC - Set up model serving for low-latency requests
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this example, you build a model to predict the quality of Portugese "Vinho Verde" wine based on the wine's physicochemical properties. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The example uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, presented in [*
# MAGIC Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub) [Cortez et al., 2009].
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC This notebook requires Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning.  
# MAGIC If you are using Databricks Runtime 7.3 LTS ML or below, you must update the CloudPickle library using the commands in the following cell. 

# COMMAND ----------

# These commands are only required if you are using a cluster running DBR 7.3 LTS ML or below. 
import cloudpickle
assert cloudpickle.__version__ >= "1.4.0", "Update the cloudpickle library using `%pip install --upgrade cloudpickle`"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Importing Data
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC In this section, you download a dataset from the web and upload it to Databricks File System (DBFS).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/ and download both `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv` to your local machine.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. From this Databricks notebook, select *File* > *Upload Data*, and drag these files to the drag-and-drop target to upload them to the Databricks File System (DBFS). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC     **Note**: if you don't have the *File* > *Upload Data* option, you can load the dataset from the Databricks example datasets. Uncomment and run the last two lines in the following cell.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Click *Next*. Some auto-generated code to load the data appears. Select *pandas*, and copy the example code. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Create a new cell, then paste in the sample code. It will look similar to the code shown in the following cell. Make these changes:
# MAGIC   - Pass `sep=';'` to `pd.read_csv`
# MAGIC   - Change the variable names from `df1` and `df2` to `white_wine` and `red_wine`, as shown in the following cell.

# COMMAND ----------

# If you have the File > Upload Data menu option, follow the instructions in the previous cell to upload the data from your local machine.
# The generated code, including the required edits described in the previous cell, is shown here for reference.

import pandas as pd

# In the following lines, replace <username> with your username.
white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/shared_uploads/<username>/winequality_white.csv", sep=';')
red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/shared_uploads/<username>/winequality_red.csv", sep=';')

# If you do not have the File > Upload Data menu option, uncomment and run these lines to load the dataset.

#white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
#red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0

data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0)

# Remove spaces from column names
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)

# COMMAND ----------

data.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Data Visualization
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Before training a model, explore the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import seaborn as sns
sns.distplot(data.quality, kde=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Box plots are useful in noticing correlations between features and a binary label.

# COMMAND ----------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dims = (3, 4)

f, axes = plt.subplots(dims[0], dims[1], figsize=(25, 15))
axis_i, axis_j = 0, 0
for col in data.columns:
  if col == 'is_red' or col == 'quality':
    continue # Box plots cannot be used on indicator variables
  sns.boxplot(x=high_quality, y=data[col], ax=axes[axis_i, axis_j])
  axis_j += 1
  if axis_j == dims[1]:
    axis_i += 1
    axis_j = 0

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md In the above box plots, a few variables stand out as good univariate predictors of quality. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - In the alcohol box plot, the median alcohol content of high quality wines is greater than even the 75th quantile of low quality wines. High alcohol content is correlated with quality.
# MAGIC - In the density box plot, low quality wines have a greater density than high quality wines. Density is inversely correlated with quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Preprocessing Data
# MAGIC Prior to training a model, check for missing values and split the data into training and validation sets.

# COMMAND ----------

data.isna().any()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are no missing values.

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train, test = train_test_split(data, random_state=123)
X_train = train.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
X_test = test.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
y_train = train.quality
y_test = test.quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Building a Baseline Model
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This task seems well suited to a random forest classifier, since the output is binary and there may be interactions between multiple variables.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code builds a simple classifier using scikit-learn. It uses MLflow to keep track of the model accuracy, and to save the model for later use.

# COMMAND ----------

from mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature
from mlflow.utils.environment import _mlflow_conda_env

# The predict method of sklearn's RandomForestClassifier returns a binary classification (0 or 1). 
# The following code creates a wrapper function, SklearnModelWrapper, that uses 
# the predict_proba method to return the probability that the observation belongs to each class.

  # When the model is deployed, this signature will be used to validate inputs.
  signature = infer_signature(X_train, wrappedModel.predict(None, X_train))
  
  # MLflow contains utilities to create a conda environment used to serve models.
  # The necessary dependencies are added to a conda.yaml file which is logged along with the model.

  mlflow.pyfunc.log_model("random_forest_model", python_model=wrappedModel, conda_env=conda_env, signature=signature)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Examine the learned feature importances output by the model as a sanity-check.

# COMMAND ----------

feature_importances = pd.DataFrame(model.feature_importances_, index=X_train.columns.tolist(), columns=['importance'])
feature_importances.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md As illustrated by the boxplots shown previously, both alcohol and density are important in predicting quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md You logged the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to MLflow. Click **Experiment** at the upper right to display the Experiment Runs sidebar. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The model achieved an AUC of 0.89. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A random classifier would have an AUC of 0.5, and higher AUC values are better. For more information, see [Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md #### Registering the model in the MLflow Model Registry
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC By registering this model in the Model Registry, you can easily reference the model from anywhere within Databricks.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following section shows how to do this programmatically, but you can also register a model using the UI by following the steps in [Register a model in the Model Registry
# MAGIC ](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/model-registry.html#register-a-model-in-the-model-registry).

# COMMAND ----------

run_id = mlflow.search_runs(filter_string='tags.mlflow.runName = "untuned_random_forest"').iloc[0].run_id

# COMMAND ----------

# If you see the error "PERMISSION_DENIED: User does not have any permission level assigned to the registered model", 
# the cause may be that a model already exists with the name "wine_quality". Try using a different name.
model_name = "wine_quality"
model_version = mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{run_id}/random_forest_model", model_name)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md You should now see the wine-quality model in the Models page. To display the Models page, click the Models icon in the left sidebar. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Next, transition this model to production and load it into this notebook from the model registry.

# COMMAND ----------

from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
client.transition_model_version_stage(
  name=model_name,
  version=model_version.version,
  stage="Production",

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md The Models page now shows the model version in stage "Production".
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can now refer to the model using the path "models:/wine-quality/production".

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Experimenting with a new model
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The random forest model performed well even without hyperparameter tuning.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code uses the xgboost library to train a more accurate model. It runs a parallel hyperparameter sweep to train multiple
# MAGIC models in parallel, using Hyperopt and SparkTrials. As before, the code tracks the performance of each parameter configuration with MLflow.

# COMMAND ----------

from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, SparkTrials, Trials, STATUS_OK
from hyperopt.pyll import scope
from math import exp

    rstate=np.random.RandomState(123)
  )

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md  #### Use MLflow to view the results
# MAGIC Open up the Experiment Runs sidebar to see the MLflow runs. Click on Date next to the down arrow to display a menu, and select 'auc' to display the runs sorted by the auc metric. The highest auc value is 0.91. You beat the baseline!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow tracks the parameters and performance metrics of each run. Click the External Link icon <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/_static/images/external-link.png"/> at the top of the Experiment Runs sidebar to navigate to the MLflow Runs Table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Now investigate how the hyperparameter choice correlates with AUC. Click the "+" icon to expand the parent run, then select all runs except the parent, and click "Compare". Select the Parallel Coordinates Plot.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Parallel Coordinates Plot is useful in understanding the impact of parameters on a metric. You can drag the pink slider bar at the upper right corner of the plot to highlight a subset of AUC values and the corresponding parameter values. The plot below highlights the highest AUC values:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/_static/images/mlflow/end-to-end-example/parallel-coordinates-plot.png"/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Notice that all of the top performing runs have a low value for reg_lambda and learning_rate. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You could run another hyperparameter sweep to explore even lower values for these parameters. For simplicity, that step is not included in this example.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC You used MLflow to log the model produced by each hyperparameter configuration. The following code finds the best performing run and saves the model to the model registry.

# COMMAND ----------

best_run = mlflow.search_runs(order_by=['metrics.auc DESC']).iloc[0]
print(f'AUC of Best Run: {best_run["metrics.auc"]}')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md #### Updating the production wine_quality model in the MLflow Model Registry
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Earlier, you saved the baseline model to the Model Registry under "wine_quality". Now that you have a created a more accurate model, update wine_quality.

# COMMAND ----------

new_model_version = mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{best_run.run_id}/model", model_name)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Click **Models** in the left sidebar to see that the wine_quality model now has two versions. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code promotes the new version to production.

# COMMAND ----------

# Archive the old model version
client.transition_model_version_stage(
  name=model_name,
  version=model_version.version,
  stage="Archived"
)

# Promote the new model version to Production
client.transition_model_version_stage(
  name=model_name,
  version=new_model_version.version,
  stage="Production"
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Clients that call load_model now receive the new model.

# COMMAND ----------

# This code is the same as the last block of "Building a Baseline Model". No change is required for clients to get the new model!
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/{model_name}/production")
print(f'AUC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))}')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Batch Inference
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are many scenarios where you might want to evaluate a model on a corpus of new data. For example, you may have a fresh batch of data, or may need to compare the performance of two models on the same corpus of data.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code evaluates the model on data stored in a Delta table, using Spark to run the computation in parallel.

# COMMAND ----------

# To simulate a new corpus of data, save the existing X_train data to a Delta table. 
# In the real world, this would be a new batch of data.
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(X_train)
# Replace <username> with your username before running this cell.
table_path = "dbfs:/<username>/delta/wine_data"
# Delete the contents of this path in case this cell has already been run
dbutils.fs.rm(table_path, True)
spark_df.write.format("delta").save(table_path)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Load the model into a Spark UDF, so it can be applied to the Delta table.

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow.pyfunc

apply_model_udf = mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf(spark, f"models:/{model_name}/production")

# COMMAND ----------

# Read the "new data" from Delta
new_data = spark.read.format("delta").load(table_path)

# COMMAND ----------

display(new_data)

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import struct

# Apply the model to the new data
udf_inputs = struct(*(X_train.columns.tolist()))

new_data = new_data.withColumn(
  "prediction",
  apply_model_udf(udf_inputs)
)

# COMMAND ----------

# Each row now has an associated prediction. Note that the xgboost function does not output probabilities by default, so the predictions are not limited to the range [0, 1].
display(new_data)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Model serving
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To productionize the model for low latency predictions, use MLflow [model serving](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/model-serving.html) to deploy the model to an endpoint.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code illustrates how to issue requests using a REST API to get predictions from the deployed model.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC You need a Databricks token to issue requests to your model endpoint. You can generate a token from the User Settings page (under the profile icon on the upper right). Copy the token into the next cell.

# COMMAND ----------

import os
os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"] = "<YOUR_TOKEN>"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Click **Models** in the left sidebar and navigate to the registered wine model. Click the serving tab, and then click **Enable Serving**.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Then, under **Call The Model**, click the **Python** button to display a Python code snippet to issue requests. Copy the code into this notebook. It should look similar to the code in the next cell. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can use the token to make these requests from outside Databricks notebooks as well.

# COMMAND ----------

# Replace with code snippet from the model serving page
import os
import requests
import pandas as pd

def score_model(dataset: pd.DataFrame):
  url = 'https://<DATABRICKS_URL>/model/wine_quality/Production/invocations'

  if response.status_code != 200:
    raise Exception(f'Request failed with status {response.status_code}, {response.text}')
  return response.json()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The model predictions from the endpoint should agree with the results from locally evaluating the model.

# COMMAND ----------

# Model serving is designed for low-latency predictions on smaller batches of data
num_predictions = 5
served_predictions = score_model(X_test[:num_predictions])
